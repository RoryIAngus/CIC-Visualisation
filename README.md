Code used to import, transform and then visualise CLARA data.

## Run Book

### Background
This code was created by me as part of a project to ingest CLARA data and then create some visualisations that are designed to be used by the class lecturer and tutors. 
If you have access to CLARA data and wish to use this node, please contact LEP to get the data extracted.
You will need a Python3 environment running Jupyter Notebooks and an instance of MongoDB.
There are YML files that can be used to configure the environments using Anaconda supplied in the Repo.
